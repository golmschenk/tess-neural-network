# Data notes
`kic.csv` comes from the `kic.txt.gz` file [here](http://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/catalogs/). It was downloaded, extracted, and the extension was changed from `txt` to `csv`. Additional notes about it can be found [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/kic.html).

`koi.csv` was taken from [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative). The "Download Table" button just needs to be used, and the downloaded file should be renamed `koi.csv`. Additional notes on that data can be found [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/data.html).
